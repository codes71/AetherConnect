# Project Showcase: Real-Time Microservices Chat Application

## Project Overview

Ever wondered how modern applications like Slack, Discord, or WhatsApp handle millions of users in real-time? This project is a deep dive into building such a system from the ground up.

This isn't just another chat app. It's a **scalable, resilient, and feature-rich chat platform** built using a professional-grade microservices architecture. You'll work with the same cutting-edge technologies and design patterns used by top tech companies. The entire project is designed to run locally on your machine using free tools like Docker and Minikube, so you can build an impressive, portfolio-ready application without any cost.

### Learning Objectives

This project is designed to help you:

  - **Explore Advanced System Design:** Go beyond simple monolithic apps. Learn how to build systems that are modular, scalable, and fault-tolerant.
  - **Develop a Feature-Rich Application:** Implement user authentication, real-time messaging with WebSockets, group chats, notifications, and even AI-powered content moderation.
  - **Master Modern DevOps & CI/CD:** Practice containerizing services with Docker, orchestrating them with Kubernetes, and automating your build/test/deployment pipeline with GitHub Actions.
  - **Build a Standout Portfolio Piece:** Create a project that demonstrates a deep understanding of backend engineering, system architecture, and modern development practices.

## Core Concepts You'll Implement

  - üì¶ **Modular Microservices:** Break down the application into small, independent services (e.g., Authentication, Messaging, Notifications). This makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and scale independently.
  - üöÄ **High-Performance Communication:** Use **gRPC** for fast, efficient, and type-safe communication between services, and **Apache Kafka** for asynchronous, event-driven messaging that decouples your services.
  - ‚ö° **Real-Time Experience:** Build a responsive, real-time frontend using **WebSockets (Socket.io)**, allowing for instant message delivery and presence updates.
  - üìà **Scalability & Resilience:** Design a system that can handle growth. Learn to scale services horizontally with **Kubernetes** and ensure the system remains available even if parts of it fail using patterns like health checks and retries.
  - üõ°Ô∏è **Robust Security:** Implement a modern security model with **JWT/OAuth2** for authentication, role-based access control, and best practices to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
  - üß† **AI Integration:** Add a touch of intelligence by integrating a pre-trained **Hugging Face Transformer model** to automatically detect and moderate message content.
  - üìä **Observability:** Learn how to monitor a distributed system. Use **Prometheus** for metrics, **Grafana** for dashboards, and **Jaeger** for distributed tracing to see how requests flow through your microservices.

## Tech Stack

  - **Backend:** **NestJS (TypeScript)** - A powerful framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
  - **Frontend:** **Next.js (React)** & **Tailwind CSS** - For a modern, server-rendered, and beautifully styled user interface.
  - **Databases & Caching:**
      - **PostgreSQL:** For structured user and authentication data (ACID compliance).
      - **MongoDB:** For flexible, scalable storage of chat messages.
      - **Redis:** For high-speed caching, session management, and real-time pub/sub.
  - **Communication & Messaging:**
      - **Socket.io:** For real-time, bidirectional communication with clients.
      - **gRPC:** For high-performance, synchronous internal service-to-service calls.
      - **Apache Kafka:** For asynchronous event streaming and decoupling services.
  - **DevOps & Infrastructure:**
      - **Docker & Docker Compose:** For containerizing applications and easy local setup.
      - **Kubernetes (via Minikube):** For orchestrating containers in a production-like environment.
      - **Helm:** For packaging and managing Kubernetes applications.
      - **GitHub Actions:** For automating CI/CD pipelines (building, testing, deploying).
  - **AI & Moderation:** **Hugging Face Transformers** - For local, powerful NLP inference.
  - **Observability Stack:** **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, & **Jaeger** - The industry-standard trio for monitoring and tracing.

## Project Structure

  - `/auth-service`: Manages user registration, login, and JWT generation.
  - `/message-service`: Handles all real-time chat logic, message storage, and AI moderation.
  - `/notification-service`: Listens for events (like new messages) and sends out notifications.
  - `/api-gateway`: A single entry point that routes client requests to the correct microservice.
  - `/frontend`: The Next.js client application where users interact with the chat.
  - `/infrastructure`: Contains all the configuration files for our system (Kubernetes YAMLs, Helm charts, Docker configs).
  - `/shared`: A common library for shared code, like gRPC protocol buffers and DTOs.

## Getting Started: Your Local Setup Guide

1.  **Prerequisites:** Install Docker, Minikube, `kubectl`, Helm, and Node.js (v20+).
2.  **Clone the Repo:** `git clone <your-project-url>` and `cd` into the directory.
3.  **Configure Environment:** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the connection details for your local services.
4.  **Launch with Docker Compose:** For a quick start, run `docker-compose up --build`. This will spin up all the services and databases on your local machine.
5.  **Deploy to Kubernetes:** To simulate a production environment, start Minikube with `minikube start` and then deploy the entire application stack with a single command: `helm install chat-app ./infrastructure/helm-chart`.
6.  **Explore:** Access your application at `http://localhost:3000` and check out your Grafana monitoring dashboards at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Your Development Journey

  - **Build the Core Services:** Start by implementing the gRPC servers and clients in the backend services using the NestJS CLI.
  - **Connect the Frontend:** Develop the React components in the Next.js app to connect to the WebSocket server and send/receive messages in real-time.
  - **Integrate AI Moderation:** In the `message-service`, add a module that passes incoming messages through the Hugging Face Transformers library to flag content.
  - **Write Your Tests:** Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) by writing unit and integration tests with Jest. Build end-to-end tests with Cypress to ensure the user flow works perfectly.
  - **Monitor Your System:** Add Prometheus metrics to your services and create custom dashboards in Grafana to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) like message latency or user sign-ups.

## Showcase Your Work

This project is more than just code‚Äîit's a story about your skills. Here‚Äôs how to make it shine in your portfolio:

  - **Create Visuals:** Use a tool like `draw.io` or Excalidraw to create a clean system architecture diagram.
  - **Write a Blog Post:** Share your learning journey. Write an article about a specific challenge you faced, like setting up distributed tracing or scaling your WebSocket layer.
  - **Add More Features:** Think about what could come next\!
      - File & Image Sharing (using a local S3-compatible service like MinIO).
      - End-to-End Encryption.
