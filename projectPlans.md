## Project Breakdown

1.  **Project Setup and Environment:**
    *   Clone the project repository.
    *   Install necessary dependencies (as specified in `README.md`).
    *   Verify the development environment is configured correctly.
    *   Set up Docker and Docker Compose.
    *   Configure environment variables for services.

2.  **Understand the Core Functionality:**
    *   Read and thoroughly understand the project description and goals in `/README.md`.
    *   Analyze the core concepts: Microservices Architecture, Real-Time Communication, Event-Driven Architecture, API Gateway, Service Discovery, Load Balancing, and Security.
    *   Understand the interactions between the different microservices.

3.  **Implement Microservices (following `/README.md` Tech Stack and Project Structure):**
    *   **auth-service:**
        *   Design and implement the database schema for users.
        *   Implement user registration endpoint.
        *   Implement user login endpoint (authentication and token generation).
        *   Implement token validation middleware/endpoint.
        *   Write unit tests for authentication logic.
    *   **user-service:**
        *   Design and implement the database schema for user profiles.
        *   Implement endpoint to get user profile information.
        *   Implement endpoint to update user profile information.
        *   Implement endpoint to get a list of users.
        *   Write unit tests for user profile management.
    *   **chat-service:**
        *   Design and implement the database schema for messages and chat rooms.
        *   Implement endpoint to create new chat rooms.
        *   Implement endpoint to add users to chat rooms.
        *   Implement endpoint to get messages for a chat room.
        *   Implement endpoint to send new messages (initial implementation).
        *   Write unit tests for chat room and message management.
    *   **realtime-service:**
        *   Set up WebSocket server.
        *   Implement WebSocket connection handling.
        *   Implement message broadcasting to connected users in a chat room.
        *   Integrate with Kafka consumer to receive new messages.
        *   Implement logic to send read receipts (optional).
        *   Write tests for WebSocket connections and message broadcasting.
    *   **api-gateway:**
        *   Set up API Gateway using chosen technology (e.g., Nginx, Traefik, or a dedicated gateway like Kong).
        *   Configure routing for all microservices.
        *   Implement authentication/authorization at the gateway level (using auth-service).
        *   Implement rate limiting and other security measures.
        *   Write tests for routing and security policies.
    *   **notification-service (optional based on `/README.md` details):**
        *   Set up a notification mechanism (e.g., email, push notifications).
        *   Integrate with Kafka consumer to receive events for notifications.
        *   Implement logic to send notifications (e.g., new message notifications).
        *   Write tests for notification delivery.

4.  **Implement Event-Driven Architecture with Kafka:**
    *   Set up Kafka cluster (using Docker Compose).
    *   Define Kafka topics (e.g., `new-messages`, `user-status-updates`).
    *   Configure producers in services sending events (e.g., `chat-service` producing `new-messages`).
    *   Configure consumers in services reacting to events (e.g., `realtime-service` and `notification-service` consuming `new-messages`).
    *   Write tests for Kafka message production and consumption.

5.  **Implement Service Discovery and Load Balancing:**
    *   Integrate a service discovery mechanism (e.g., Eureka, Consul, or built-in with the chosen framework).
    *   Configure services to register with the service discovery.
    *   Configure services to discover and communicate with each other.
    *   Implement load balancing for service instances.
    *   Write tests for service registration and discovery.

6.  **Implement Security:**
    *   Implement authentication and authorization using JWT or similar.
    *   Secure inter-service communication (e.g., using mTLS).
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization.
    *   Address common security vulnerabilities.
    *   Write security tests.

8.  **Documentation and Refinement:**
    *   Update the `/README.md` with any relevant project information, usage instructions, or findings.
    *   Create API documentation (e.g., using Swagger/OpenAPI).
    *   Add comments to the code where necessary.
    *   Refactor code for clarity and efficiency.

9.  **Final Review and Submission:**
    *   Review the entire project against the requirements and learning objectives in `README.md`.
    *   Ensure all tests pass.
    *   Prepare the project for submission.
    *   Write a project report summarizing the architecture, challenges, and learning.
